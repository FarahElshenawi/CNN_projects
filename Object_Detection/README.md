# ‚öΩ Football Player Detection with YOLOv5x

![Demo](assets/football_detection.gif)

This project uses YOLOv5x to detect football players in images and video. It applies transfer learning on a custom dataset to achieve high-accuracy, real-time object detection.

## üì¶ Features

- Fine-tuned YOLOv5x model
- Custom dataset from Roboflow
- Detects football players in both images and video
- Visual output with bounding boxes and confidence scores

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Python, PyTorch
- YOLOv5 by Ultralytics
- Roboflow for dataset handling
- OpenCV for video processing
